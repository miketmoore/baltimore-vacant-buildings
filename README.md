## Description

This is a single page application that displays information about Baltimore vacant buildings.

Server side is powered by express and the client side is powered by React+Bootstrap.

The dataset is from https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Housing-Development/Vacant-Buildings/qqcv-ihn5

This project came about from my desire to learn some new technologies for modern web development and to build data visualizations.
